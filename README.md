# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/123) goal.

Specifications

List of specifications (specs) for the completed goal. These are declarative sentences (statements) describing a feature of the final product.

This is a core goal. The specifications are non-negotiable. To complete this goal, you must complete all specs listed below.

 Artifact produced is a fork of the core-algorithms repo.
 Can run all tests with npm test.
 All tests are passing.
 For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
 a test file with at least 2 unit tests using valid inputs, and at least 1 unit test using invalid inputs.
 an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm.
Required

Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals.

 The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.
Stretch

Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Java...) and write tests & implementations for each.

 Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
 For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
 a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
 an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
Quality Rubric

Well formatted code

Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. npm run lint). [50 points]
Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]
Clear and useful README

Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]
Proper dependency management

There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. npm install) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README. [50 points]
Good project management

Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person. [25 points]

## Installation and Setup

npm install

## Usage and Examples
